You MUST summarize the conversation above into a structured handoff summary for another LLM to resume the task.

IMPORTANT: If the conversation ends with an unanswered question or a request awaiting user response (e.g., "Please run command and paste output"), you MUST preserve that exact question/request. Every question or request still awaiting an answer MUST appear in Critical Context on its own line prefixed `UNRESOLVED:`, never buried inside narrative prose.

You MUST record each item exactly once: a completed task belongs under "Done" only, open work under "In Progress" only. You MUST leave out what no longer carries the task — problems already solved, approaches already abandoned, context already superseded.

You MUST use this format (sections can be omitted if not applicable):

## Goal
[User goals; list multiple if session covers different tasks.]

## Constraints & Preferences
- [Constraints or requirements mentioned]

## Progress

### Done
- [x] [Completed tasks/changes]

### In Progress
- [ ] [Current work]

### Blocked
- [Issues preventing progress]

## Key Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [Brief rationale]

## Next Steps
1. [Ordered list of next actions]

## Critical Context
- [Important data and references still needed to continue; prefix each still-open question with `UNRESOLVED:`]

## Additional Notes
[Anything else important not covered above]

You MUST output only the structured summary; you NEVER include extra text.

Sections MUST be kept concise. You MUST preserve exact file paths, function names, error messages, and relevant tool outputs or command results. You MUST include repository state changes (branch, uncommitted changes) if mentioned.
